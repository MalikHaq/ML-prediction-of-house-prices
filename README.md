# House Price Prediction Project using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to create predictive models for estimating house sale prices in Ames, Iowa. It aims to understand and predict the factors influencing house prices, encompassing both dwelling-related and neighborhood-related attributes.

### Dwelling-Related Factors

Dwelling-specific attributes like size, quality, and condition play a crucial role in determining house prices. Notable attributes such as 1stFlrSF (First Floor square feet), OverallQual (overall material and finish quality), and 2ndFlrSF (Second Floor square feet) are key factors in predicting house sale prices.

### Neighborhood-Related Factors

Neighborhood attributes, including school quality, nearby amenities, and overall area appeal, significantly impact property values. These features collectively contribute to the market value of a property.

## Dataset Details

The project employs the Ames Housing dataset, comprising information on 1,460 homes sold between 2006 and 2010 in Ames, Iowa. The dataset contains 81 features encompassing numeric attributes detailing sizes and categorical attributes describing house features, quality, and environmental conditions.

## Project Objectives

The primary goals of this project include:

1. **Model Development:** Constructing predictive models utilizing machine learning techniques (e.g., linear regression, random forest) to estimate house sale prices.
  
2. **Identifying Influential Factors:** Determining significant factors affecting house prices, both dwelling-specific and neighborhood-related.
  
3. **Exploratory Analysis:** Investigating relationships between average sale prices and specific attributes such as Neighborhoods, Garage Quality, Paved Drive, Functional, and Sale Condition.
  
4. **Temporal Trends:** Analyzing changes in house prices over time to uncover temporal patterns or fluctuations.
  
5. **Neighborhood Insights:** Identifying the top 10 neighborhoods in Ames, Iowa, with the highest predicted median house prices.

This repository contains code, data, and insights derived from the house price prediction project. It showcases the application of machine learning to real estate data, aiming to predict house prices effectively. Explore the code, analysis, and findings obtained from this project.
